# this is where we define the api for querying our data
# this is different than the prisma.graphql file in that
# that file defines everything that can possibly be queryed
# and is automatically generated by prisma upon deploy
# while this file more narrowlly defines what we are exposing
# for use by this app and is something we create and edit

# the actuall implementation of these mutations and queries
# is set up in two separate files, "Mutations.js" and "Query.js".
# however, the signature of the mutations and queries here must
# matched in the other two files.

# The below comment is actually a Prisma feature that allows
# us to import things from the generated prisma model file
# so that we don't have to redefine them here

# import * from './generated/prisma.graphql'
